    "There was no one determining class in order to survive. You need a mixture of at least two for the males. For me, I took a look at an adult male in the third class. I tried changing him to being in first class, but he was still dead. Making him either a female or a child didn’t change that either (I didn't mess with the crew because they were probably dead). From the first few observations I could already see that females would probably live unless they were in a lower class. So the question now was, \"what would allow a male to live\"? So I changed him to being a child and found that the only way a child were to not live, was if they were in the third class (I checked, and there were no children in the crew). In terms of adult men, all of had a high probability of dying. Based off of this, I can say that the majority of people that lived were middle class to upper class females lived (all children except for 3rd class males lived). So pretty much all males were probably going to die, and since this was in the early 1900's men probably had the duty to protect the women and kids. If you were a third class kid regardless male or female, nobody really cared about you and you were probably going to die.  \n",
